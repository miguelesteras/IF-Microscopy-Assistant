%% Phase 5.5 Train Recurrent Network with input delay (pyrenn)
%   ======================================================================
%   Code by Miguel Esteras-Bejar, 07/2017
%   This code is part of the project:
%   'Tracking of temporally occluded or overlapping structures in live cell
%   microscopy'
%   This codes aims to:
%   1. Train a Recurrent network with input delay using the pyrenn
%   package and the fourier descriptors.
